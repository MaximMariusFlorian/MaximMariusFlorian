- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MaximMariusFlorian

I'm for some time now a QA Tester in the gaming industry and recently i've started to develop my skills and learn new programs 

- My purpose is to learn to use programs such as Postman and MySQL while also developming skills in automation testing using Python language and Selenium, and who knows, maybe start a carrer in game development
